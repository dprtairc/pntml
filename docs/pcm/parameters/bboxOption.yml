  Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are
  selected. The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers,
  depending on whether the coordinate reference system includes a
  vertical axis (elevation or depth):

  Only point clouds within the bounding box are selected. 
  The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, 
  depending on whether the coordinate reference system contains a 
  vertical axis (elevation or depth).

  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

  The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS84
  longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84).
  For WGS84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence
  of minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum
  latitude. However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the
  first value (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value
  (east-most box edge).
