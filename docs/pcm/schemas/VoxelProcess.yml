          If "true", a map will be created containing the center coordinates of 
          each cell and the distance from that center point to the nearest point.
          If the number of cells or the number of points is large, processing will be stopped due to the server load.
          If "false", a map will be created containing the center coordinates of 
          each cell and the Bit value indicating the presence or absence of the point cloud in the cell.
          The bit value is "1" if there is a point cloud in the cell, and "0" otherwise.
