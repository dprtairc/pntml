  PntML uses the information to transform each point in the posted point cloud.

  Each point is transformed based on the information of `transform`.
  The transformed points are based on the coordinate system specified in `transformCRS`.

  The value of 'origin' is the origin point of the posted point cloud based on WGS84.
  Each point is transformed using by using quaternion of Euler angles and scale values.

  origin:
    description: |
      The origin coordinates of the posted point cloud based on WGS84.

      The default value is [0,0,0].
      The unit of each value is Decimal Degree (DD) of WGS84, but not Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS).

      The format is [longitude, latitude] or [longitude, latitude, altitude].    
      Note that the order is not latitude and longitude.

      Before transforming the coordinates of each point, the origin point is transformed  from WGS84 to the coordinate system specified by `transformCRS`.

      For example: 
      If the following JSON is given, WGS84-based origin (139.7780996958115, 35.61846131695731, 0) is transformed to (-5003.445813743943, -42328.165818379086, 0) in JGD2011 / Japan Plane Rectangular CS IX (EPSG:6677).
      This transformed origin coordicates are used as the origin of the posted point cloud.
      ```JSON
      {
        "transformCRS": "http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/6677",
        "transform": {
          "origin": [139.7780996958115, 35.61846131695731, 0],
          "euler": [0,0,0],
          "scale": [1,1,1]
        }
      }
      ```

      If `transformCRS` is not specified, `transformCRS` is determined based on the value of `origin` from the following range of codes. Te coordinate system covering the location specified in `origin` is selected as the value of `transformCRS` from the following CRSs.
      * <http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/32601> to <http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/32660>
      * <http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/32701> to <http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/32760>
      
      
      For example: If the value of `origin` is located in Tokyo, the value of `transformCRS` becomes <http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/32654>, because EPSG:32654 covers Tokyo.
